Premise: no one is required to do anything.

At any point we may say *this is not a priority* and everyone goes home.

The software shall exist in whatever state we choose to leave it, even a non-existent state.

Corollary: no software is required to exist.

Priority is chosen. As soon as priority is required, we enter the realm of policy:

> *The software shall exist.*
<br>*The software shall be functional.*
<br>*The software shall be good.*
