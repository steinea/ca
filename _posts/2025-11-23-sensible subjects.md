Two years on.[^1] We try to begin again---*perpetual beginning.*[^2]

Delirium finds its rule and the rule finds its others; rules so associated are the movement of the subject, and subjects associated in turn are the movement of culture. Culture *is* to effectuate this association. No rule before culture, no subject before the rule.

We study tendency and habit, the subject as effect and effecting. A science of effectivity, practical sociology of the world. All these ways of *making do*.[^3]

Begin again.

In Chapter 1 of *Empiricism and Subjectivity*, Gilles Deleuze formulates the mind as a collection of experiences, and indeed as *identical to* those experiences.[^4] This collection is originally without organization, without system; only when *subjected* by the world does the collection become a system, the mind a subject. The subject is partial and passional, an effect of the world.

[^4]: Gilles Deleuze, *Empiricism and Subjectivity: An Essay on Hume’s Theory of Human Nature*, 1953, trans. Constantin V. Boundas (New York, NY: Columbia University Press, 1991), 21-23.

In Chapter 2, Deleuze examines the rules of this subjection. Rules are the means of the satisfaction of the passions. Passions are necessarily socially affected, insofar as subjects are always already social in their constitution. So, rules are the means of social affection, bringing about the integration of sympathies in the various institutions and enterprises of human social being.[^5] This integration is culture, the moral world, the order of ends.[^6]

[^5]: Deleuze, *Empiricism and Subjectivity*, 39-41.
[^6]: Deleuze, *Empiricism and Subjectivity*, 33.

In Chapter 3, Deleuze describes how rules for the satisfaction of the passions come to be general rules of culture. The most successful rules reflect and extend individual passions, liberating the passions from their individual limits. Culture is a project of this expanded passion, and indeed, is the world as such *into which* the passions are projected and integrated with the passions of others. Thus, in culture, the mind finds constancy for its passions, made subject to the world *as* an intention, a purpose.[^7] The subject is always already directed or inclined, a project of the world. There are no "faculties" or "occult qualities" of consciousness to be discovered here, only the durable intentions of culture as a collective project of human practical reason.[^8]

[^7]: Deleuze, *Empiricism and Subjectivity*, 55-63.
[^8]: Deleuze, *Empiricism and Subjectivity*, 70, 64.

So, as we at least reach Chapter 4, "God and the World," Deleuze tries to find an example of a schematism that "would bring together all the significations that we have successively attributed to general rules."[^9] For Deleuze, the best such example is that of religion, though the argument that follows is typically Deleuzian in its diagonality.[^10]

[^9]: Deleuze, *Empiricism and Subjectivity*, 73.
[^10]: Deleuze, *Empiricism and Subjectivity*, 73. For diagonality, see Alexander R. Galloway, “Graphic Formalism,” *ASAP Journal*, March 27, 2023, <https://asapjournal.com/graphic-formalism-on-the-bias-alexander-r-galloway/>.

Deleuze argues that there are two types of rules---"extensive" and "corrective"---and two sources for rules---"passion" and "knowledge"---amounting to four total "kinds" of rule: extensive rules of passions, corrective rules of passions, extensive rules of knowledge, and corrective rules of knowledge.[^11] Deleuze sees polytheistic and theistic religions as the two essential "feeling[s]" of his general category of "religion," with polytheism extending the passions, and theism extending knowledge.[^12] Importantly, in both expressions, religion "confuses the accidental with the essential."[^13] Polytheism schematizes the "diversity" and "irreducibility" of the passions as the activity of the gods, while theism schematizes the "unity of the spectacle of nature" in perception as God's unique effect, thereby serving as his proof.[^14] Each schematization is, for Deleuze, ultimately a "fiction of the imagination," an essentialization of the source (i.e., the collection of experience) *as* schema (i.e., the systematization of the collection).[^15]

[^11]: Deleuze, *Empiricism and Subjectivity*, 73. Recall that passion is identified with practical reason, "the establishment of a whole of culture and morality," while knowledge is identified with theoretical reason, "the determination of the detail of nature, that is, of parts submitted to calculation" (64). The former "proceeds in terms of probabilities (experimental reason, *understanding*)" while the latter "proceeds on the basis of *certainty* (intuition and demonstration)" (65). While passion and knowledge, practice and theory, should be understood as distinct poles of reason, in *Empiricism and Subjectivity* passion and practice are always prior to knowledge and theory.

While different in source, the two feelings of religion, the polytheistic and theistic, constitute for Deleuze a "dual system of extensive rules," which are, in the framework laid out in Chapter 2, also referred to as operations of "*determination*" (along with operations of "*establishment*" and "*correction*").[^16] We only briefly touched on this framework in the essay on this chapter, so it is worth doubling back and more clearly articulating it now, since there is some difference in argumentation between Chapters 2 and 4.[^17]

[^16]: Deleuze, *Empiricism and Subjectivity*, 75, 50.
[^17]: Eric Stein, "A Model of Actions," June 18, 2023, <https://steinea.ca/2023/06/18/a-model-of-actions/>

Establishment, determination, and correction make up the "three dimensions" of a "general rule," which Deleuze defines as a "system of directed means" for the satisfaction of passions.[^18] The general rule integrates individual passions in an institution, a "model of actions."[^19] The sum of these institutions constitutes culture or society, which is, therefore, nothing other than a "set of conventions founded on utility."[^20]

[^18]: Deleuze, *Empiricism and Subjectivity*, 41.
[^19]: Deleuze, *Empiricism and Subjectivity*, 45-46.
[^20]: Deleuze, *Empiricism and Subjectivity*, 46.

The dimensions of the general rule are distinct but "simultaneous" in their operation.[^21] The rule is "*established* by interest and utility" and is "*determined* by the imagination."[^22] This determination is the process of subjection whereby a subject is revealed as a possible model for the unordered collection of the mind, a model that is the reflection of the passional drives in the imagination in the form of a subject that could ultimately satisfy those drives.[^23]

[^22]: Deleuze, *Empiricism and Subjectivity*, 49.
[^23]: Deleuze, *Empiricism and Subjectivity*, 48-49.

Insofar as the determination is always a determination of "possible circumstances" of realization, the third operation of the general rule is required: *correction*. Correction resolves the "lack of adequation between real persons and possible situations."[^24] As such, correction operates in the mode of *belief*---the extension "must itself become now a real situation," not just a possible one, and in order for this to happen, individual passions "must become the most distant," and integrated, social passions must become "the nearest."[^25] The possible situation must be *believed* as *actually possible*, and so to this end the corrective operation imbues the "general interest" with "the vividness that only particular interests can have for us naturally."[^26]

[^25]: Deleuze, *Empiricism and Subjectivity*, 50.
[^26]: Deleuze, *Empiricism and Subjectivity*, 51.

To return to Chapter 4, Deleuze speaks of the dimensions of the general rule as discrete rules in themselves (extensive, corrective), and it is for this reason that I have used the term "operation" as a synonym for dimension in the preceding paragraphs. This ambiguity in the text makes interpretation difficult, but having now walked carefully through Deleuze's earlier argument, it becomes more obvious how the four kinds of "rules" of religion unite the significations attributed to general rules previously. And it is here where Deleuze poses the challenge to his readers of how correction might operate in the context of religion: "as religion is corrected, what is really left of it?"[^27] If religion is a confusion, fiction, or fancy of the imagination (*accidental confused for essential*), how can it hope to withstand the "total critique" of correction?[^28]

[^27]: Deleuze, *Empiricism and Subjectivity*, 76.
[^28]: Deleuze, *Empiricism and Subjectivity*, 76.

As discussed above, correction closes the gap of adequation between the real and the possible by way of belief. But if, as Deleuze initially posits, the possibility of religion is itself a confusion, that gap can never be closed. The gods disappear in "an abstraction without proportion" and the supreme effect of creation is abolished as a "fictitious usage of causality."[^29] By the operation of correction, religion, for Deleuze, is reduced to "pure imagination and mere fancy."[^30] A deflationary end, if not for the subsequent turn that Deleuze performs in a repetition of Hume.

"To believe in miracles is a false belief," Deleuze asserts, "but it is also a true miracle."[^31] The principles of association are revealed to be operative even in a vacuum, and it is this sheer fact, disclosed for Deleuze by his particular interpretation of religion, that renders religion "justified ... in its very special situation, outside culture and outside true knowledge."[^32] While the principles of association can neither "know the world as an effect of divine activity" nor "know God as the cause of the world," the principles remain effective.[^33] The principles simply *are*, without "cause" or "origin"---we may only speak of their genesis in the apophatic mode, of God in the negative as that which causes the principles to cohere in the first place.[^34]

[^31]: Deleuze, *Empiricism and Subjectivity*, 76.
[^32]: Recall Deleuze, *Empiricism and Subjectivity*, 23: the principles of association, "contiguity, resemblance, and causality" are that which "organize the given [of experience] into a system, imposing constancy on the imagination."
[^33]: Deleuze, *Empiricism and Subjectivity*, 77. Compare Deleuze, *Empiricism and Subjectivity*, 25: "philosophy, being a human science, need not search for the cause; it should rather scrutinize effects. The cause cannot be *known*; principles have neither cause nor an origin of their power. What is original is their effect upon the imagination."
[^34]: Deleuze, *Empiricism and Subjectivity*, 77.

Deleuze names this coherence or "*original agreement*" of the principles of association "purposiveness."[^35] The correction of religion renders this coherence in diagrammatic form, not as an object of knowledge to be "known," but as the mode of "thought" as such.[^36] "The idea of God, as originary agreement, is the thought of something in general"---in other words, the idea of God is the most abstract *determination* of the original coherence of "origin" (nature) and "qualification" (human nature).[^37] Practical and theoretical reason are always partial, and in their operation can grasp any number of principles that "can furnish us with a coherent discourse on the origin of the world."[^38] But *generic thought*, purposiveness, precedes all such reasoning, is the basis of reasoning, is that which makes it possible for us to "transcend the other perspectives which are equally possible, and to remind us that we are always confronted with partial analogies."[^39] Generic thought is "indifferent," which is to say, it does not differentiate, distinguish, or decide.[^40] Generic thought *purposes*, is directed; it *tends* and *tilts* this way and that, a force or impulse toward the world.[^41] Generic thought is the possibility of habituation by the world; it is the primacy of qualification over qualities, signification over signs, individuation over individuals; it is the very movement of subjectivation.

[^35]: Deleuze, *Empiricism and Subjectivity*, 77. Deleuze pulls this idea from Hume: "Purpose will be thought, albeit not known, *as the original agreement between the principles of human nature and nature itself.* 'There is a kind of pre-established harmony between the course of nature and the association of our ideas.' *Purpose gives us therefore, in a postulate, the originary (originelle) unity of origin and qualification.*"

[^39]: Many resonances here. For my own thought on the matter, see Eric Stein, "Generic Science: Heraclitus, Intelligence, and the Common," March 28, 2021, <https://steinea.ca/2021/03/28/generic-science/>. In my work, I have relied heavily on Edmund Husserl's concept of "double sensation" in *Ideas Pertaining to a Pure Phenomenology and to a Phenomenological Philosophy. Second Book: Studies in the Phenomenology of Constitution*, 1952, trans. Richard Rojcewicz and André Schuwer (Dordrecht, NL: Kluwer Academic Publishers, 1989), 155, and Maurice Merleau-Ponty's concept of "naïve contact" in *Phenomenology of Perception*, lxx. My use of "generic thought" here deliberately invokes the "generic science" of Francois Laruelle, which is predicated on the operation of what he terms "non-thetic transcendence" (NTT) in *Philosophies of Difference: A Critical Introduction to Non-Philosophy*, 1986, trans. Rocco Gangle (London, UK: Continuum, 2010), 202: NTT is "no longer relative to" the "World and its attributes" in "the sense at any rate of philosophical, that is, traditional (positing and posited), transcendence: *it supposes the simple 'support' or vehicle of this given without forming again with it any philosophical decision.*" Through the close reading undertaken in the present essay, it has become clear to me that Deleuze provides us with a formulation of Laruellian non-philosophy over thirty years in advance.
[^40]: Deleuze, *Empiricism and Subjectivity*, 77. Generic thought appears here as the non-predicative thought of the phenomenological epoché or reduction in Husserl, *Ideas Pertaining to a Pure Phenomenology and to a Phenomenological Philosophy. First Book: General Introduction to a Pure Phenomenology*, 1913, trans. F. Kersten (Dordrecht, NL: Kluwer Academic Publishers, 1983), 66, which is the "operation necessary to *make 'pure' consciousness, and subsequently the whole phenomenological region, accessible to us.*" The notion of "pure consciousness" came under severe critique in Jacques Derrida, *Voice and Phenomenon: Introduction to the Problem of the Sign in Husserl's Phenomenology*, 1967, trans. Leonard Lawlor (Evanston, IL: Northwestern University Press, 2011), and has been a subject of critique throughout much of my work. See especially my *Fiction in the Integrated Circuit* (Master's thesis, Trinity Western University, 2018), <https://arcabc.ca/islandora/object/twu%3A456>. Deleuze's formulation presents us with a means of recovery for the phenomenological tradition and a linkage with Laruelle's non-philosophy, insofar as generic thought can never be returned to as some "degree zero" or "garden" state of consciousness. The coherence of generic thought is the *condition* of possibility for all thoughts, for all principles of reason. It is the original movement by which and through which the mind is *determined*, becomes a subject, is made subject *to* the world.
[^41]: Deleuze, *Empiricism and Subjectivity*, 77: "In certain respects, purposiveness is more an *élan vital*, and less the project or the design of an infinite intelligence." Here, Deleuze is most certainly drawing on Bergson. See Henri Bergson, *Creative Evolution*, 1907, trans. Arthur Mitchell (London, UK: Macmillan Publishers, 1912).

Having used religion to draw the diagram of purposiveness, Deleuze turns to a third confusion of the principle of causality that Hume discusses in his *Treatise*.[^42] The first confusion, typified for Deleuze by polytheism, is that of "repetitions which do not proceed from experience" (passions essentialized as gods); the second confusion, typified for Deleuze by theism, is that of "a particular object---the world---which cannot be repeated, and which is not, properly speaking, an object" (knowledge essentialized as the unity of the world).[^43] Citing Hume, these are considered confusions of causality because:

[^42]: It should be emphasized that Deleuze's use of religion is precisely that, a *use*, and not entirely sensitive to the real complexity and plurality of historical *religions*. While unpacking his argument in this chapter, I was inclined to recall several sources from my studies that complicate and/or nuance Deleuze's simple schematism of religion. On theism see Theophile James Meek, "Monotheism and the Religion of Israel," *Journal of Biblical Literature* 61, no. 1 (March 1942): 21-43; on the relationship between theoretical knowledge and Christian theology, see Francis Oakley, "Christian Theology and the Newtonian Science: The Rise of the Concept of the Laws of Nature," in *Creation: The Impact of an Idea*, 54-83, ed. Daniel O'Connor and Francis Oakley (New York, NY: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1969); on the intellectual acceptability of religious belief, see Alvin Plantinga, *Warranted Christian Belief* (Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press, 2000); and on the leap of faith, see Søren Kierkegaard, *Fear and Trembling*, 1843, trans. Howard V. Hong and Edna H. Hong (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1983). I do not think any of these sources present an impossible challenge to nor threaten to overturn Deleuze's argument, but Deleuze's discussion of religion would certainly benefit from a more thorough engagement with the literature in religion and theology. I leave this footnote here as a note to self, or for another motivated reader to pursue.
[^43]: Deleuze, *Empiricism and Subjectivity*, 78.

> It is only when two *species* of objects are found to be constantly conjoined, that we can infer the one from the other; and were an effect presented, which was entirely singular, and could not be comprehended under any known *species*, I do not see, that we could form any conjecture or inference at all concerning its cause.[^44]

[^44]: David Hume, cited in Deleuze, *Empiricism and Subjectivity*, 75.

The gods extend the passions, are determined *as* gods; the world extends knowledge, is determined *as* the supreme effect of God. We have already seen how the operation of correction simultaneously deflates the determination while revealing the diagram of purposiveness. What, then, can we learn from the third confusion? The third is actually the problem proper of Hume's thought, that of the "belief in the distinct and continuous existence of bodies" as Deleuze puts it,[^45] or in Hume's words, "the continu'd existence of objects in order to connect their past and present appearances, and give them such an union with each other, as I have found by experience to be suitable to their particular natures and circumstances."[^46]

[^45]: Deleuze, *Empiricism and Subjectivity*, 78.
[^46]: Hume, cited in Deleuze, *Empiricism and Subjectivity*, 78.

This is the "*crux metaphysicorum*" of Hume's philosophy, the "concept of cause" as such.[^47] And for Deleuze, it is the very connection of past and present appearances of objects, the *fact* of this union, that achieves the "resolution of the contradiction that would arise between the conjunction of two objects in actual experience and the appearance of one of them only in my perception."[^48] Polytheism gives us repetition, theism gives us the unrepeatable, and insofar as these two reasons, connected in the "dual system" of religion, together reveal the diagram of purposiveness at their base, Deleuze can say that this "fiction of the imagination" is the very operation whereby appearance gains its "coherence and regularity."[^49] Importantly, we must reiterate that this operation should not be understood as a *faculty* of the mind. The mind is first and foremost a "delirium."[^50] The mind has no system in itself; it is merely an "assemblage of things."[^51] For the mind to become a subject, it must be determined, and this determination is not something done "*by*" the mind but rather "*in*" the mind.[^52] The association of ideas in the imagination, the systematization of the collection of experience, is not brought about by the subject: "[r]ather than finding its origin, association finds in the imagination its terms and its object."[^53] Association *produces* the subject; association comes from *outside*.

This argument forms the kernel of Deleuze's "transcendental empiricism."[^54] Qualities are not *possessed* by the subject but are rather *encountered* in the world. It is this very encounter that determines the subject as a subject. This is why Deleuze describes his philosophy as an "aesthetics," a "science of the sensible."[^55] Purposiveness, generic thought, is mind "apprehend[ing] directly in the sensible that which can only be sensed, the very being *of* the sensible."[^56] This *grasp* of the sensible is fleeting, but in its repetition the grasp is extended, determined, and corrected, becoming the *rule* of continuity as such, so laying the template for all other general rules. We see, then, that the concept of cause is to be found, at bottom, in the repetition of the *generic contact* between the mind and the sensible, in the generalization of the most infinitesimal moment of sense. An "outright fiction" at the very foundation of reason, fantasy and madness as the bases of continuity and consistency.[^57] Philosophy is left to decide "*between the contradiction or nothingness*," as Deleuze puts it, or citing Hume, "betwixt a false reason and none at all."[^58]

"Modern philosophy" offers no remedy, Deleuze argues, only "hopes" for a resolution of the contradiction, "and there lies its error."[^59] The supposed "permanent, irresistible, and universal principles" of the mind (as posited by some philosophers) cannot be separated from the "variable, fanciful, and irregular principles"; reason cannot be separated from madness.[^60] Deleuze, on the other hand, does not take this as reason for despair, but rather as impetus to *begin again*. Indifference, fancy, madness, delirium---his philosophy starts here, because *we*, as purposive beings, start here. "The only resource and positivity offered to the mind is nature or practice," the "middle and temperate region," the domain of *effectivity*, of making do.[^61]  For "good sense" to emerge from the contradiction, "the mind *must* be referred to nature," is *always already* referred to nature, in and through the projects of "moral practice" and "understanding" whereby the subject is constituted, necessarily and originally, as a *sensible subject*.[^62] This sensibility is both the root of the contradiction and the means by which the contradiction "is regulated by possible corrections and resolved through practice."[^63] Sensibility is "life," activity, everyday pragmatics; sensibility is "science," the possibility of a generic thought that touches, hypothesizes, experiments, learns.[^64] Sensibility is perpetual beginning which, put otherwise, is to say that sensibility is the "eternal return," the "infinite which belongs to a single time, the eternity which belongs to an instant," being with "no beginning or end."[^65]

We find ourselves "always in the middle, between things, interbeing, *intermezzo*," contradiction as "conjunction," "and ... and ... and," beginning never from a "clean slate" or "ground zero," but from the "middle," more and less than beginning, always "coming and going rather than starting and finishing."[^66] To cite another text, this is where we find ourselves, in finding that "something already was going on," that "the response is already there before the call goes out," that we are "already in something."[^67] Thus spoke Zarathustra: *whatever you will, will it in such a manner that you also will its eternal return*.[^68] Begin again, begin right here, in the thick of things, just as you always have.
